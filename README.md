# Audio-Equalizer
Created a 6-band audio equalizer by implementing bandpass filters using butterworth filter design. Used Python tkinter library to create the desktop GUI. The application allows
users to play an audio file(wav format) and boost frequencies in certain frequency bands to change how the audio sounds.


# What is an audio equalizer?<br>
An equalizer (also called an “EQ”) is an audio filter that isolates certain frequencies and either boosts them, lowers them, or leaves them unchanged. 
Each sound has different frequencies that make it unique, and an equalizer lets you change the levels of these frequencies.<br><br> The lower frequency ranges,
typically between 20Hz to 250Hz, are bass frequencies. These frequencies are responsible for the deep and powerful sounds in music.
Treble frequencies, on the other hand, are the higher frequency ranges, typically between 2kHz to 20kHz, that make up the high-end
of the sound spectrum. These frequencies are responsible for the clarity and sharpness of the music.<br><br>
An equalizer adjusts audio output so that certain frequencies are emphasized over others.<br>
For example, you can adjust the bass frequency to make the music sound more powerful, or you can adjust the treble frequency to make it sound sharper.
